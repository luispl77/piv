Step 2: Procrustes Analysis and Point Cloud Registration(preliminary)The second step aims at reconstructing the whole scene using images from aninstrumented vehicle. Using state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction and 3D point cloudregistration techniques applied to this new set of images, the information gathered in thefirst step may be mapped on the virtual model of the intersection or city block. This waywe cease to require the expensive yet trivial services provided by Google.Datasets available at:●https://drive.sipg.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/s/4bzxRSCLX6L2Zmw●Google DriveFurther details:●  You'll  be  given  a sequence of images and corresponding depth maps.Additionally, you will be given keypoints and the descriptors of each image thathave the same format as ‘kp.mat’ from part 1.2 .●  You’ll need to estimate the (rigid / similarity / affine) transformation between pointclouds and then merge all point clouds into a single one.Specifications:The input file will ‘cams_info.mat’, which has a dictionary/struct with N entries (one foreach image), each containing:○  ‘focal_lenght’: camera intrinsics (focal length ‘fx’, ‘fy’ with principal point‘(cx,cy)’ at the center of the image plane)○  ‘rgb’: RGB image○  ‘depth’: depth map○  ‘conf’: confidence mapThe output of your code must be saved in the current directory and must include:●  Merged pointcloud in a file ‘output.mat’.●  Transformations for each pointcloud, in a ‘transforms.mat’, containing thedictionary/struct with N entries (one for each pointcloud), with ‘R’ 3x4 rotationmatrix and ‘T’ 3x1 translation vector.
